# UAI - Understanding Artificial Intelligence

## About

Given the need to understand how *machine learning algorithms* work, I created this repository to carry out tests with different types of data and programming languages ​​in a **didactic way**, with a **beginner to expert** approach.

And then I saw that there was already a group with this same name, which did a much better and bigger job than I thought. 
That's why I reference [this group](https://understandingai.iea.usp.br/), and I continue with my personal studies, believing that they can be useful to someone too.

If you would like to improve documentation, add your webpage to the list below, or fix a minor inconsistency or bug, please feel free to send a PR directly to `master`.
For more complex issues/bugs or feature requests, please open an issue using the appropriate template.
