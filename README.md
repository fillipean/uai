# UAI - Understanding Artificial Intelligence

## About

Given the need to understand how machine learning algorithms work, I created this repository to carry out tests with different types of data and programming languages ​​in a **didactic way**, with a **beginner to expert** approach.

And then I saw that there was already a group with this same name, which did a much better and bigger job than I thought. 
That's why I reference [this group](https://understandingai.iea.usp.br/), and I continue with my personal studies, believing that they can be useful to someone too.
